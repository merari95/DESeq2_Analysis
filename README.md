Differential gene expression analysis of count data

BACKGROUND: Analyzing RNA-seq count data from the airway dataset, which contains airway smooth muscle cell samples that were:

-treated with dexamethasone (a corticosteroid drug), and

-untreated (control samples).

OBJECTIVE: Identify which genes show significant differences in expression between treated and untreated samples. (i.e. Which genes are up-regulated (more highly expressed after dexamethasone)? Which genes are down-regulated (less expressed after dexamethasone)?
